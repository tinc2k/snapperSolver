# SnapperSolver #
A solver for the game [Snappers](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emerginggames.snappers&hl=en), including a level editor, running version of the game and history of previously played games.

## Tech ##
The game, it's level editor and game history were build using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. The solver is written in C#, and the whole thing is glued together with some ASP.NET MVC4. Displayed history of previously played games uses HTML5 [Web Storage](http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/), so be sure to use a browser that supports the feature. The solution can be compiled in Visual Studio 2012 or newer and used via it's Development Server, or deployed on Azure and similar hosting platforms.

## Code quality ##
This is a *quick-and-dirty*, *hackathon-quality* application written for [Clarity Consulting](www.claritycon.com)'s first Tech Challenge for Offshore Teams.
